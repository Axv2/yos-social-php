Yahoo! OS PHP SDK
=============
After downloading and unpackaging the release, copy the contents of yosdk/lib 
to a directory that is accessible via the PHP require/require_once methods. In 
your PHP scripts, require the Yahoo.inc file:

    require("Yahoo.inc");

or

    require_once("Yahoo.inc");

Now you should be ready to instantiate your YahooSession object and get
started.

Sample Application
==================
In the yosdk/sample directory you'll find sampleapp.php, a sample application 
that will get you started. Put the file in your hosting directory and fill 
in the consumer key, consumer key secret and application ID. When you're done, 
point your browser at the URL. You will be directed to verify access to the 
application and then you will be redirected back to your application.
